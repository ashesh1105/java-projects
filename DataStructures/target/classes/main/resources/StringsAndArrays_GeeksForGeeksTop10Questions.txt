*****String / Array*****
------------------------
1. Reverse a string without affecting special characters
Given a string, that contains special character together with alphabets (‘a’ to ‘z’ and ‘A’ to ‘Z’),
reverse the string in a way that special characters are not affected.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-an-array-without-affecting-special-characters/

Examples:
Input:   str = "a,b$c"
Output:  str = "c,b$a"
Note that $ and , are not moved anywhere.
Only subsequence "abc" is reversed
Input:   str = "Ab,c,de!$"
Output:  str = "ed,c,bA!$"

2. All Possible Palindromic Partitions
Given a string, print all possible palindromic partitions.

Example:
Input: nitin
Output: n i t i n, n iti n, nitin
Input: geeks
Output: g e e k s, g ee k s


3. Count triplets with sum smaller than a given value
Given an array of distinct integers and a sum value. Find count of triplets with sum smaller than given sum value.
Expected Time Complexity is O(n2).
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-triplets-with-sum-smaller-that-a-given-value/

Example:
Input : arr[] = {-2, 0, 1, 3}, sum = 2.
Output : 2
Explanation :  Below are triplets with sum less than 2
               (-2, 0, 1) and (-2, 0, 3)

Input : arr[] = {5, 1, 3, 4, 7}, sum = 12.
Output : 4
Explanation :  Below are triplets with sum less than 12
               (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 7) and
               (1, 4, 5)

4. Convert array into Zig-Zag fashion
Given an array of DISTINCT elements, rearrange the elements of array in zig-zag fashion in O(n) time. The converted
array should be in form a < b > c < d > e < f.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-array-into-zig-zag-fashion/

Example:
Example:
Input:  arr[] = {4, 3, 7, 8, 6, 2, 1}
Output: arr[] = {3, 7, 4, 8, 2, 6, 1}

Input:  arr[] =  {1, 4, 3, 2}
Output: arr[] =  {1, 4, 2, 3}


5. Generate all possible sorted arrays from alternate elements of two given sorted arrays
Given two sorted arrays A and B, generate all possible arrays such that first element is taken from A then from B
then from A and so on in increasing order till the arrays exhausted. The generated arrays should end with an element from B.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generate-all-possible-sorted-arrays-from-alternate-elements-of-two-given-arrays/

Example:
A = {10, 15, 25}
B = {1, 5, 20, 30}

The resulting arrays are:
  10 20
  10 20 25 30
  10 30
  15 20
  15 20 25 30
  15 30
  25 30

6. Pythagorean Triplet in an array
7. Length of the largest subarray with contiguous elements
8. Find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of any subset of a given array
9. Smallest subarray with sum greater than a given value
